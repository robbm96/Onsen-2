Onsen will help its users improve their overall mental and physical well being. Our application will remind the user when it is getting close to their specified bedtime to help them keep them on schedule even during their busiest days. Onsen allows the user to choose from a selection of white noises that will play while they sleep to ensure a calm mind and a great night's sleep.

Onsen monitors the surrounding ambience to keep track of noise level and phone movement during sleep hours, allowing the user to view a summary of that nightâ€™s sleep patterns. Onsen will also allow the user to view meditation videos so the user can maintain relaxation outside of sleep and hopefully bring their mind to a calm place during their daily lives.

### Notes
While working on part 2 of this app, I realized the value of version control and keeping track of your code base changes. I worked on a large portion of the project just to realize I had made a huge mistake and could no go back. I had to start the project from scratch. 

Also this project was the first one I was able to collaborate with others which made it fun to code together
